"""Guards against the documentation drifting away from the product — and away
from the other three products it is deliberately kept in step with.

Orion, Iris, Proteus and Argus share a README skeleton, a commercial licence
structure and a price-list format on purpose: the same clause sits at the same
number in all four, so a buyer or a contributor who has read one has read them
all. Nothing enforces that at runtime, and a drifting document is invisible to
anyone editing the code — so it is checked here.

A price quoted in two places will eventually disagree with itself, and a
screenshot referenced after being renamed leaves a broken image on the
project's front page. Both are checked here too.
