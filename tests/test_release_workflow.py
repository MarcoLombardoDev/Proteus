"""Tests for .github/workflows/release.yml and .github/release-body.md.

GitHub Actions is the only thing that can actually run the workflow, so these
tests parse the checked-in files instead. They exist because every bug they
guard against has already been shipped once, in one of these four projects:

- a release published with no title, showing only the bare tag;
- notes produced by ``--generate-notes``, which dumps the commit log — for a
  first release, the entire project history — where a description of what is
  being downloaded should be;
- a release created through GitHub's own "Draft a new release" page, which
  makes ``gh release create`` fail, leaving the fallback path to publish a
  release with whatever title the web UI defaulted to;
- a download table promising macOS and Linux builds that the workflow never
  actually built.
