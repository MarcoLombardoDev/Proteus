# Commercial Licence — Proteus

**Proteus — Rebranding Tool**
Copyright © 2026 Marco Lombardo

Proteus is dual-licensed. It is available under the
[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE) at no cost, and under the commercial
terms in this document for those who cannot accept the AGPL's obligations.

Both licences cover **the same software**. There is no crippled edition, no feature held
back behind a paywall, no licence key and no phone-home. What you buy is **permission**,
not functionality.

That includes every capability: bulk replacement, visual content search, images inside
Office documents and inside PDFs. Nothing is reserved for a paid tier, now or later.

> **To buy, or to ask anything commercial — including whether you need this at all —
> email [marco.lombardo@gmail.com](mailto:marco.lombardo@gmail.com?subject=Proteus%20commercial%20licence%20enquiry).**
> Email is the only commercial channel: quotes, contracts, invoicing and pre-sales
> questions all go there. GitHub Issues are for bugs and feature requests.

> This page is a **commercial offer and a summary of terms**, not the signed agreement.
> The binding contract is the licence certificate issued per customer. It is not legal

## 1. Do you actually need this?

Most people do not. Read this before reading the price list.

| What you want to do | Licence you need |
|---|---|
| Use Proteus inside your organisation, however many people, however many machines | **AGPL — free.** Nothing to buy, nothing to declare. |
| Modify it for your own internal use and keep the changes to yourself | **AGPL — free.** |
| Publish a fork, or ship a modified version to someone else | **AGPL — free**, provided you release your modified source under AGPL-3.0. |
| Run a modified Proteus as a closed-source internal tool, for your own staff only | **Commercial** |
| Ship Proteus, or code derived from it, inside a **closed-source product** you distribute | **Redistribution** |
| Run a modified Proteus as a **hosted or SaaS service for your customers**, without publishing your source | **Redistribution** |
| Redistribute it to your customers under **your own name or branding** | **Redistribution** |
| Your organisation's policy forbids AGPL code, and you need it in writing | **Commercial** (or **Redistribution**, if you also distribute) |

**Internal use is free, permanently, for organisations of any size.** Anyone telling you
otherwise about an AGPL project is mistaken. Buy a commercial licence when the AGPL's
*distribution* terms are the problem — not simply because you are a company.

The dividing line is one rule: **AGPL-3.0 is free as long as the source stays open.**

Three kinds of licence, not four price points on one list:

- **Community** — the AGPL-3.0 build. Free, unlimited, internal use of any size.
- **Commercial** — removes the AGPL's copyleft obligation for **closed-source internal
  use**. Sized by the licensee's employee count. See §3.
- **Redistribution** — grants the right to **ship Proteus, or a derivative of it, to third
  parties** — embedded, OEM'd, resold, or offered as a service to your own customers. See
  §4. It is a different kind of licence from Commercial, not a bigger version of it: a
  five-person software house redistributing a product to ten thousand customers needs
  Redistribution, not a large Commercial tier.

Every tier, in every branch, is the **same software** under §1 of this document: no
feature is gated behind a higher tier.

---

## 3. What the Commercial licence grants

Subject to payment and to the tier purchased, a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence,
for **one named legal entity**, to:

1. use, copy and modify Proteus;
2. deploy it as an internal, closed-source tool, without publishing your modified source;
3. run it as an internally-accessed network service without triggering AGPL section 13,
   provided access is limited to your own authorised users and installations.

It does **not** automatically include, at any Commercial tier:

- redistribution to third parties, in any form;
- OEM or embedding in a product you ship;
- sublicensing;
- use by other companies in the same corporate group, unless the Enterprise tier's
  group-wide scope has been explicitly agreed and named in the certificate.

Any of those needs a **Redistribution licence** instead of, or alongside, Commercial — see
§4.

### 3.1 The four Commercial tiers

| Tier | Employees | |
|---|---|---|
| **Small** | 1–49 | Same model as every Commercial tier below, sized for a small organisation: one legal entity, internal use, non-redistributable. |
| **Medium** | 50–249 | Same model, applied to a mid-sized organisation. Still organisation-based, internal-use, single legal entity, non-redistributable. |
| **Large** | 250–999 | Same model, applied to a larger organisation. Still limited to the internal use of the one authorised legal entity. |
| **Enterprise** | 1,000+, **or** any Corporate Group scope | Covers at least one of: an organisation of 1,000+ employees; an organisation belonging to a corporate group; a use case that needs a group-wide perimeter; use by more than one legal entity of the same group, when explicitly authorised. May be named **Enterprise / Group Commercial Licence** in the certificate, which must state exactly which legal entities are included. |

Belonging to a large group does not, by itself, let a small subsidiary's Small-tier
licence cover the rest of the group. A group-wide perimeter is never implied — it must be
explicitly agreed and named entity by entity. See §3.3.

### 3.2 Employee count

Unless the applicable Enterprise / Group agreement states a different scope:

> Employee count refers to the total number of employees of the licensed legal entity.

It does **not** automatically include customers, end users, suppliers, partners, or
external consultants.

### 3.3 Corporate Group

A **Corporate Group** is a set of companies directly or indirectly controlled by the same
parent company, or otherwise part of the same corporate structure, as defined in the
applicable agreement.

Membership in a group is not, by itself, authorisation for the group. A small company
belonging to a large group cannot use a Small-tier licence to extend rights to the rest of
the group — a group-wide perimeter must be expressly authorised and stated in the
Enterprise certificate.

---

## 4. What the Redistribution licence grants

A **Redistribution licence** is required whenever Proteus, or any part of it, is passed on
to a third party — regardless of organisation size. Examples:

- incorporation into another piece of software;
- embedding;
- distribution alongside a proprietary product;
- distribution to customers or to end users;
- commercialisation of a derivative product;
- integration into a proprietary application;
- OEM scenarios;
- distribution as a component of a commercial solution.

"OEM" is used above as an example of a Redistribution scenario, not as a separate category
of its own — see §14 in spirit: OEM, embedded and other redistribution scenarios are all
covered by the Redistribution licence.

Subject to payment and to the specific agreement, a Redistribution licence may grant:

1. modification, integration and embedding rights;
2. the right to distribute the result, in source or binary form, with no obligation to
   publish your own source;
3. the right to commercialise the resulting product;
4. sublicensing of these rights to your own end users, **solely as part of your product**,
   not as a standalone competing tool.

It does **not** automatically grant: exclusivity; unlimited sublicensing; rights to the
Project Owner's trademarks; rights to third-party dependencies (§9); or transfer of the
licence to another party.

### 4.1 Redistribution — Standard

For ordinary commercial redistribution: software houses, ISVs, integrators, commercial
developers, and businesses embedding Proteus in a product, distributed to a non-exceptional
number of customers or installations.

### 4.2 Redistribution — Enterprise

For redistribution at scale: large software houses and groups, worldwide distribution,
high-volume products, millions of users or installations, large-scale commercial
platforms, and large OEM programmes.

Unlike Commercial, this tier is **not** primarily sized by employee count. The relevant
factors, weighed per case in the agreement, include: number of products; number of
customers; number of installations; distribution volume; number of end users; territory;
the product's revenue; number of legal entities involved; and the level of support
required. The exact perimeter is defined in the commercial agreement, not by a fixed
threshold in this document.

---

## 5. Price list

All prices in **EUR, excluding VAT**, per **licensee organisation** — the legal entity and,
where the tier says so, the agreed group perimeter. Seats are never counted: you are not
billed per developer, per user or per installation.

| Tier | Price | Scope |
|---|---:|---|
| **Community** | **Free** | Everything Proteus does, under AGPL-3.0. Unlimited internal use. |
| **Commercial — Small** | **€500 / year** | 1–49 employees. Closed-source internal use, one legal entity. |
| **Commercial — Medium** | **€1,000 / year** | 50–249 employees. Same model as Small. |
| **Commercial — Large** | **€1,800 / year** | 250–999 employees. Same model as Small and Medium. |
| **Commercial — Enterprise** | **from €2,900 / year** | 1,000+ employees, or a group-wide perimeter. Unlimited internal products and services within the agreed scope. Written answers to procurement and legal questionnaires. |
| **Redistribution — Standard** | **€1,900 / year** | Ordinary commercial redistribution: embed it in a product you sell, or run it as a hosted service for your customers. |
| **Redistribution — Enterprise** | **from €7,000 / year** | Large-scale redistribution: worldwide distribution, high-volume products, large OEM programmes. Scope priced per case. |

### What every paid licence includes

The same commitments, at every tier above Community:

- **Email support** — see §6. Always included, never sold separately to a paying customer.
- **Updates for the whole term.** Every version released while your subscription is active
  is licensed to you; there is no separate charge for upgrading within a term.
- **No retroactive charge.** Renewals are priced at the rate in force when you first bought,
  for as long as you renew without a gap.
- **Cancel any time.** No notice period, no auto-renewal trap. An invoice is issued per
  term; not paying it ends the subscription.

### Discounts

| Who | What |
|---|---|
| Fewer than 10 employees **and** under €1M annual revenue | **50% off** any Commercial tier |
| Registered non-profits, accredited academic institutions, published research | **Free commercial licence** — ask |

---

## 6. Support

**Every paying customer gets support. It is included in the price, at every paid tier, and
it runs over email.** There is no support product to buy separately and no tier that leaves
you on your own.

| Tier | Support | Target first response |
|---|---|---|
| Community | GitHub Issues, best effort | — |
| Commercial — Small / Medium | Email | 5 business days |
| Commercial — Large | Email | 3 business days |
| Commercial — Enterprise | Email, private channel | 2 business days |
| Redistribution — Standard | Email | 3 business days |
| Redistribution — Enterprise | Email, private channel | 2 business days |

What "support" means here, stated plainly so nothing is inferred:

- **Included:** installation and configuration problems, questions about intended behaviour,
  diagnosis of suspected bugs, guidance on using Proteus for your case, and licensing or
  compliance questions.
- **A response commitment, not a fix commitment.** The target above is how quickly you get a
  human reply, not how quickly a defect is resolved. Confirmed bugs are prioritised over
  new features, but no repair window is guaranteed at any tier.
- **Not included:** building your workflow for you, writing features, or operating the
  software on your behalf. That is custom development — see §7.

---

## 7. Custom development

Anything that changes the software for you — a new feature, an integration, a format, a
connector, a bespoke build — is **never included in a licence fee**, at any tier.

It is **available on request and quoted separately**, per project:

1. You describe what you need.
2. You get a written scope, a fixed price and a delivery window before any work starts.
3. Nothing is invoiced until you accept that quote.

The indicative day rate for Proteus is **€450 / day**, used to size a quote; the quote
itself is fixed-price, not time-and-materials.

Two things worth knowing before you ask:

- **A commercial licence is not required to commission work.** AGPL users can pay for
  custom development too.
- **By default the result is merged into the public project** under AGPL-3.0, which is why
  the rate is what it is. If you need it kept private, say so at quoting time: exclusive or
  unpublished work is priced differently.

## 8. How to buy

1. **Ask.** Write to **[marco.lombardo@gmail.com](mailto:marco.lombardo@gmail.com?subject=Proteus%20commercial%20licence%20enquiry)**.
   Say what you intend to build, roughly how big your organisation is (for Commercial), or
   how the software will reach third parties (for Redistribution). Use email rather than a
   public issue: what you are building is usually not something you want indexed.
2. **Confirm the tier.** You get a written statement of which tier applies and why — for
   Commercial, the employee count that was used; for Redistribution, the factors from §4.2
   that were weighed — so there is no ambiguity later.
3. **Invoice.** Issued in EUR, payable by bank transfer within 30 days.
4. **Certificate.** On payment you receive a signed licence certificate naming your
   organisation (and, at Enterprise scope, every included legal entity), the tier, the term
   and the covered products. That certificate — not a key file — is the licence.

To get a concrete quote in one round instead of three, include: your **company** and the
legal entity that would hold the licence; the **intended use** (internal, or distributed to
third parties); **organisation size** or **distribution scale**, as applicable; the **tier**
you think fits; and whether you need **custom development**.

There is **no licence key, no activation, no phone-home.** The software behaves identically
whether or not you have paid. Compliance is contractual and self-declared; there is no
audit clause.

---

## 9. Term, warranty and liability

- **Term.** Annual from the invoice date, unless the certificate says otherwise.
- **Updates.** Included for the duration of the term.
- **Warranty.** Proteus is provided **as is**. No warranty of merchantability, fitness for a
  particular purpose, or non-infringement. Read the [Disclaimer](README.md#disclaimer) — this tool overwrites files in place.
- **Liability.** Total aggregate liability under a commercial licence is limited to **the
  fees paid in the twelve months preceding the claim**. Liability is not excluded where it
  cannot lawfully be excluded — death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or
  wilful misconduct.
- **Indemnity.** No IP indemnity at Commercial Small/Medium/Large or Redistribution
  Standard. Commercial Enterprise and Redistribution Enterprise may include one; ask, and
  it will be stated in the certificate.
- **Governing law.** Italian law, courts of Milan, unless the certificate names otherwise.

---

## 10. What is *not* included

Stated plainly, so nobody discovers it after paying:

- **No SLA on the software itself.** Response targets are commitments about replying to
  you, not about fixing anything within a window.
- **No custom development.** Quoted separately — see §7.
- **No guarantee of future features.** The roadmap is not a contract.
- **No exclusivity.** The same licence is available to your competitors.
- **No rights to third-party components.** See §11.
- **No hosted service.** Proteus is a desktop application and a command line. There is nothing to sign into.
- **No implied redistribution rights on a Commercial licence**, and no implied group-wide
  scope without an explicit Enterprise perimeter. See §3.

---

## 11. Third-party components

A commercial licence covers Proteus's own code. Its dependencies are separately licensed and
a commercial licence cannot and does not relicense them.

| Component | Licence | Commercial redistribution |
|---|---|---|
| Python, `tkinter` | PSF License | ✅ Permissive |
| Pillow | MIT-CMU (HPND) | ✅ Permissive |
| `pypdf` | BSD-3-Clause | ✅ Permissive — used for PDF support |
| ttkbootstrap | MIT | ✅ Permissive, optional |
| PyInstaller | GPL-2.0 **with bootloader exception** | ✅ The exception exists to allow proprietary frozen applications |

**Every dependency is permissively licensed and safe to redistribute in a commercial
product.** No dependency imposes copyleft, field-of-use or anti-commercial conditions.

Two deliberate choices behind that sentence, since they are the kind that get made
carelessly:

- **PDF support uses `pypdf` (BSD-3-Clause), not PyMuPDF.** PyMuPDF is offered under
  AGPL-3.0 or a paid Artifex licence. A commercial licence to Proteus cannot relicense
  somebody else's copyleft code, so a buyer would have needed a second licence from a
  third party to ship the product — which would make the sentence above false. `pypdf` is
  slower for some workloads and it was chosen anyway.
- **Office packages need no library at all.** Proteus reads and writes them with the
  Python standard library; `python-docx`, `python-pptx` and `openpyxl` are test-only and
  are not shipped.

Verify these against the versions you actually ship. They are listed in good faith, current
as at the version of this document, and are not a legal opinion.

## 12. Contributors

Contributions are accepted under the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md), which grants
the Project Owner the right to license contributed code under both AGPL-3.0 and commercial
terms. That grant is what makes dual licensing possible: without it, a single contributed
patch would block commercial licensing for everyone.

Contributors keep the copyright in their work, and receive a perpetual, royalty-free
commercial licence to Proteus for their own use, as thanks.

## 13. Contact

**Commercial licensing, quotes and support for paying customers:
[marco.lombardo@gmail.com](mailto:marco.lombardo@gmail.com?subject=Proteus%20commercial%20licence%20enquiry)**

For anything that is *not* a purchase — a bug, a feature request, a question about which
row of §1 you fall into — the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MarcoLombardoDev/Proteus/issues) is the better channel, and the
answer helps whoever asks next.

---

## 14. Terminology

This document uses **Community**, **Commercial** and **Redistribution** as the three
licence families. **OEM** is deliberately not used as a top-level category: it appears only
as an example, because it describes one *scenario* within Redistribution, not a distinct
set of rights —

> OEM, embedded and other redistribution scenarios are covered by the Redistribution
> Licence.

Naming it this way keeps the category general enough to apply to whichever commercial
model a redistributor actually uses, instead of forcing OEM deals through a differently
worded licence than an equivalent embedding or hosting deal.
