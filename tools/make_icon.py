"""Draw the application icon: the initial, in black, on white.

One letter, a serif face, a thin frame. The four products share the drawing
and differ only in the letter, so a taskbar with all four open reads as one
family rather than four unrelated programs.

The face is Liberation Serif, metric-compatible with Times New Roman and
redistributable; Times New Roman itself is neither free nor present on the
machines that build these. The output is committed rather than generated at
build time, so no release depends on which fonts a runner happens to have.

Every size is drawn for itself rather than scaled down from one master. A
frame that reads as a hairline at 256 pixels is a smear at 16, and the letter
that has room to breathe at 256 has to fill the square at 16 to be a letter at
all. Scaling one drawing gives the small sizes -- the ones actually on the
taskbar -- to whichever end of the range was drawn first.
