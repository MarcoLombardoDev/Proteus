@echo off
rem Start Proteus, after checking that the executable is the one this archive
rem was built with.
rem
rem The archive ships Proteus.exe.sha256 beside the executable. This script
rem recomputes that digest with certutil, which is part of Windows, and
rem compares. What that catches is a truncated download, a half-finished
rem unpack, a disk that has started rotting -- damage, which is the failure
rem that actually happens to people.
rem
rem What it does NOT catch is tampering. The checksum travels inside the same
rem zip as the file it describes, so anyone able to alter the executable could
rem alter the checksum in the same breath. The check worth doing against that
rem is on the zip itself, using the .sha256 published as a separate release
rem asset -- it reaches you by a different path, which is the whole point. The
rem README says how.
rem
rem This script does not remove the SmartScreen warning and cannot: only a
rem code-signing certificate does that.
