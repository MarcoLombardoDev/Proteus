@echo off
rem Start Proteus, after checking that the executable is the one this archive
rem was built with.
rem
rem The archive ships Proteus.exe.sha256 beside the executable. This script
rem recomputes that digest with certutil, which is part of Windows, and
rem compares. What that catches is a truncated download, a half-finished
rem unpack, a disk that has started rotting -- damage, which is the failure
rem that actually happens to people.
rem
rem What it does NOT catch is tampering. The checksum travels inside the same
rem zip as the file it describes, so anyone able to alter the executable could
rem alter the checksum in the same breath. The check worth doing against that
rem is on the zip itself, using the .sha256 published as a separate release
rem asset -- it reaches you by a different path, which is the whole point. The
rem README says how.
rem
rem This script does not remove the SmartScreen warning and cannot: only a
rem code-signing certificate does that.

rem before it will let any of them load, and a onefile build unpacks itself
rem into a temporary folder on top of that -- and a console that vanishes
rem instantly leaves nothing on screen for that whole wait.

rem processes: the executable that starts is a bootloader that unpacks itself
rem and re-runs itself, and the copy that opens the window is its child. The
rem bootloader never has a message loop, so WaitForInputIdle on it waited out
rem the whole timeout while the program sat there on screen, and the console
rem then announced that nothing had happened. Reported from a onefile build; a
rem onedir build is a single process and looked fine, which is how it went
rem unnoticed.
rem
rem Both processes carry the same image name, so watching the name covers
rem either shape. Death is read from the process Start-Process handed back
rem rather than from the name disappearing: a onefile bootloader outlives its
rem child, so that handle going away means the whole thing is gone, and it
rem cannot race the first poll the way a name lookup can.
