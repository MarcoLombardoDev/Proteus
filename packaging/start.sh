# Start Proteus, after checking that the executable is the one this archive was
# built with.
#
# The archive ships a `.sha256` beside the executable. This script recomputes
# that digest and compares. What that catches is a truncated download, a
# half-finished unpack, a disk that has started rotting — damage, in other
# words, which is the failure that actually happens to people.
#
# What it does NOT catch is tampering. The checksum travels inside the same
# archive as the file it describes, so anyone able to alter the executable
# could alter the checksum in the same breath. The check worth doing against
# that is on the archive itself, using the `.sha256` published as a separate
# release asset — it reaches you by a different path, which is the whole
# point. The README says how.
#
# Portable /bin/sh on purpose: it runs on the Linux build and, renamed
# start.command so Finder will double-click it, on the macOS one.
